  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and
  coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.
  This is cycle 4 of the IAF spinup. 
  Configuration physics is identical to 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle3 but executables and
  diagnostics have changed, and sea ice and ocean coupled BGC is included.
  1 Jan 1958 initial conditions are from final 1 Jan 2019 restart from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle3
  and BGC tracers generated by https://github.com/COSIMA/input_om2-bgc/tree/5ec65b4
  with my_choice == '01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4', except for oxygen, which is initialised at 1 Jan 1979
  from csiro_bgc.res.nc generated by https://github.com/COSIMA/input_om2-bgc/tree/6868e9b.
  BGC tracers have no effect on the physical state, and oxygen has no effect on other BGC tracers.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff 
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  61-year spin up, from 1 Jan 1958 to 1 Jan 2019.
  This run is extended from 1 Jan 2019 to the present day in 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4_jra55v150_extension.

  Sea ice data was accidentally deleted from April 2002 to the end of 2018, apart from 6-hourly ice area from 2014-2016 inclusive.
  This was re-generated by https://github.com/COSIMA/01deg_jra55_iaf/tree/01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4_rerun_from_2002
  which also added daily aicen, vicen and 3-hourly uvel, vvel, divu, shear for 2016.
  This re-generated data (including the extra 2016 outputs) has been added to this experiment's output on cj50.
  2d and 3d BGC data has 2, 3, or 4 decimal digits of precision - see https://github.com/COSIMA/01deg_jra55_iaf/blob/386771b/reduce_sigfig.sh#L13-L93
