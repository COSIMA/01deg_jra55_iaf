description: >-
  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and
  coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.
  This is a branch of 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4_jra55v150_extension, branched at
  1 July 2023 and forced with preliminary JRA55-do v1.5.0.1, using the same parameters.
