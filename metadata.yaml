  Extensions of cycle 4 of 0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 + WOMBAT BGC global model 
  configuration with JRA55-do v1.5.0 and v1.5.0.1 interannual forcing
long_description: >-
  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020)
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements
  summarised by Solodoch et al. (2022) https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL097211,
  and coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice as described by
  Hayashida et al. (2023) https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JC019697 and
  Menviel et al. (2023) https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-390.
  Further details can be found in the draft ACCESS-OM2 technical report
  https://github.com/COSIMA/ACCESS-OM2-1-025-010deg-report and the forum
  https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-om2-control-experiments/258.
  This is an extension to cycle 4 of the IAF spinup, simulating from 1 Jan 2019
  to near-present day. Configuration physics is identical to
  01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4, except forcing is JRA55-do v1.5.0 and v1.5.0.1,
  not v1.4.0. This will cause a small forcing shock at the start of this
  simulation. Only finalised JRA55-do v1.5.0.1 data is used (not preliminary
  near-real-time data). Initial conditions are from final 1 Jan 2019 restart
  from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4. Run with JRA55-do v1.5.0 (2019 only) and
  v1.5.0.1 (1 Jan 2020 onwards) interannually-varying forcing with all solid
  runoff converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up from 1 Jan 2019 to near-present day.
