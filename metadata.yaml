  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature (NB: should have been 
  conservative temperature - see https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/issues/206)
  and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff 
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  61-year spin up, from 1 Jan 1958 to 1 Jan 2019.

  Additional output from 1 Jan 1987 (run 116) onward:
  - daily mean sea ice area and volume, by category (aicen, vicen)
  - monthly mean 3d bih_fric_u, bih_fric_v, u_dot_grad_vert_pv
  - daily mean 3d conservative temperature, practical salinity, u, v, wt (not yet synced to ik11)
  Additional output from 1 Jan 2012 (run 216) onward:
  - monthly snapshot 2d sea_level
  - monthly snapshot 3d salt, temp, u, v, vert_pv and vorticity_z
