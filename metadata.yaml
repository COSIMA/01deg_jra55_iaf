description: |-
  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1958 and runs to 1 Jan 2019.
