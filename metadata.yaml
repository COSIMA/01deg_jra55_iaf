  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and
  coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.
  This is cycle 4 of the IAF spinup, repeating from 2002 onwards to re-generate
  accidentally-deleted ice data.
  Outputs are as for 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4, except all MOM output and 6-hourly ice output were omitted
  (as these weren't deleted), and daily aicen, vicen and 3-hourly uvel, vvel, divu, shear were added for 2016.
  Configuration physics is identical to 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4.
  Initial conditions are from 1 Jan 2002 restart from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff 
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  17-year rerun, from 1 Jan 2002 to 1 Jan 2019.
