  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  This is cycle 3 of the IAF spinup. 
  Configuration physics is identical to 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle2 but executables and
  diagnostics have changed.
  Initial conditions are from final 1 Jan 2019 restart from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle2.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff 
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  61-year spin up, from 1 Jan 1958 to 1 Jan 2019.
