  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements and
  coupled biogeochemistry in the ocean and sea ice.
  This is an extension to cycle 4 of the IAF spinup, simulating from 1 Jan 2019 to near-present day.
  Configuration physics is identical to 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4, except forcing is JRA55-do v1.5.0 and v1.5.0.1,
  not v1.4.0. This will cause a small forcing shock at the start of this simulation.
  Initial conditions are from final 1 Jan 2019 restart from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf_cycle4.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.5.0 (2019 only) and v1.5.0.1 (1 Jan 2020 onwards) interannually-varying forcing
  with all solid runoff converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up from 1 Jan 2019 to near-present day.
