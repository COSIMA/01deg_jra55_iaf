version: null
description: >-
  Cycle 1 of 0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration with JRA55-do
  v1.5.0 OMIP2 interannual forcing
long_description: >-
  0.1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020)
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements
  summarised by Solodoch et al. (2022) https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL097211.
  Further details can be found in the draft ACCESS-OM2 technical report
  https://github.com/COSIMA/ACCESS-OM2-1-025-010deg-report and the forum
  https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-om2-control-experiments/258.
  The vertical diffusivity is different from 01deg_jra55v140_iaf.
  This is cycle 1 of the JRA55-do v1.5.0 IAF spinup. 
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature (NB: should have been 
  conservative temperature) and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.5.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1958 and runs to 1 Jan 2019.
  Only a limited amount of output was saved.
