# 01deg_jra55_iaf
Standard configuration for 0.1 degree [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2) experiment (ACCESS-OM2-01) with JRA55-do interannual forcing (IAF).

For usage instructions, see the [ACCESS-OM2 wiki](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/wiki).

Run length and timestep are set in `accessom2.nml`. The timestep is normally set to a factor of the JRA55-do forcing period of 3hr = 10800s, for example one of 100, 108, 120, 135, 144, 150, 180, 200, 216, 225, 240, 270, 300, 360, 400, 432, 450, 540, 600, 675, 720, 900, 1080, 1200, 1350, 1800, 2160, 2700, 3600 or 5400s. The default timestep for this configuration is 540 seconds, but for model stability you will need a shorter timestep (e.g. 300s then 450s) over the first year or so of model equilibration. After the model is running stably with a 540s timestep you might be able to increase it to 600s for faster throughput.

**NOTE:** All ACCESS-OM2 model components and configurations are undergoing continual improvement. We strongly recommend that you "watch" this repo (see button at top of screen; ask to be notified of all conversations) and also watch [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2), all the [component models](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/tree/master/src), and [payu](https://github.com/payu-org/payu) to be kept informed of updates, problems and bug fixes as they arise.
