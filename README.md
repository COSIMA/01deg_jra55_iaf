# 01deg_jra55_iaf
Standard configuration for 0.1 degree [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2) experiment (ACCESS-OM2-01) with JRA55-do interannual forcing (IAF).

For usage instructions, see the [ACCESS-OM2 wiki](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/wiki).

Run length and timestep are set in `accessom2.nml`. The timestep is normally set to a factor of the JRA55-do forcing period of 3hr = 10800s, for example one of 100, 108, 120, 135, 144, 150, 180, 200, 216, 225, 240, 270, 300, 360, 400, 432, 450, 540, 600, 675, 720 or 900s. The configuration is supplied with a 300s timestep which is stable for a startup from rest, but very slow. **After the model has equilibrated for a few months you should increase the timestep to 450s and then to 540s** for improved throughput. You may even find it runs stably at 600s.

**NOTE:** All ACCESS-OM2 model components and configurations are undergoing continual improvement. We strongly recommend that you "watch" this repo (see button at top of screen; ask to be notified of all conversations) and also watch [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2), all the [component models](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/tree/master/src), and [payu](https://github.com/payu-org/payu) to be kept informed of updates, problems and bug fixes as they arise.
